# :dancer: Upcoming Events

## Props Night
	
Our next event will be all about CSS Properties & Co. We're having lightning talks! ⚡️
Each talk has to be between 5 to 15 min and about one CSS property or selector of your choice.

Choose your favorite property or selector, something you're using all the time or just found out about. The agenda will be curated at the beginning of the event. Every attendee is welcome to contribute one lightning talk! Talks can be in English or German, whichever you're more comfortable with.
	
**When?** Wednesday, March 27 @ 18:30</br>
