# :rocket: Our Vision & Mission

We strive to be an inclusive and supportive meetup focused on CSS and design on the web and organise talks, workshops, coding nights and social events to improve the knowledge of and attitude towards CSS. We also encourage, support and help community members, especially those underrepresented in tech, contribute with their own content.
