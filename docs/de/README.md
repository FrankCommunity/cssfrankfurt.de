# Welcome to CSS Frankfurt :tada:

Welcome to the CSS Frankfurt-family, we are so happy to have you join us!

This Meetup is for anyone interested in CSS and design on the web. We organise talks, workshops, coding nights and social events to improve the knowledge of and attitude towards CSS. We also encourage, support and help community members, especially those underrepresented in tech, contribute with their own content.

If you are interested in giving talks, workshops etc. please let us know by filling out our [Speaking @ CSS Frankfurt form](https://goo.gl/forms/rnX4ZGFvYN9Mm8Sk1) or contacting Victoria or Anett directly!

To get the latest updates about our events and what we're up to, please follow us on Twitter: [@cssfrankfurt](https://twitter.com/cssfrankfurt)

If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, our inbox is always open. You can message us directly here on Meetup or reach out on Twitter ðŸ’Œ

We look forward to seeing you at one of our events!
